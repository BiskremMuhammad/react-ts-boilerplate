# Surreal 3.0 React App

### IMPORTANT!

1. When working on a feature, source out a new branch from `development` and prefix the new branch with `[SR-####] name your branch` .

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same applies to commits as possible, ex: `[SR-####] your commit message`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which SR-#### is the ticket id replacing the `#` with the ticket number on Jira.

2. Before you create the pull-request, make a `git pull origin development` and the push your code and raise a PR.
